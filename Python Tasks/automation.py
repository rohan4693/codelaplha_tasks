# Explanation:

# Import Libraries:

# os: Provides file system interaction functions.
# datetime: Used for handling file creation dates.
# rename_files Function:

# Takes folder_path and prefix as arguments.
# Iterates through files in the folder.
# Filters for specific file types (adjust extensions as needed).
# Gets the file creation time using os.path.getctime(file_path).
# Formats the creation date using datetime.strftime.
# Constructs a new filename with the prefix, date, and original filename.
# Uses os.rename to rename the file.
# Prints a confirmation message.
# Example Usage:

# Replace folder_path with the actual path to your folder.
# Customize the prefix to match your naming convention.
# Call the rename_files function with the desired arguments.
# Benefits:

# Saves time and effort compared to manual renaming.
# Reduces the risk of errors from repetitive tasks.
# Can be easily modified to handle different file types or naming conventions.
# Additional Ideas for Automation:

# Data cleaning: Write scripts to handle specific data cleaning tasks in CSV, Excel, or other file formats using libraries like pandas.
# System maintenance: Automate tasks like generating reports, backing up data, or running system checks.
# File organization: Create scripts to move files based on specific criteria or sort them automatically.
# By leveraging Python's capabilities, you can free yourself from repetitive tasks and focus on more productive aspects of your workflow.
